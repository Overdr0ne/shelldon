;;; Commentary:

;; https://github.com/Overdr0ne/shelldon
;; Shelldon is largely just a modification of async-shell-command that
;; provides a more complete minibuffer workflow by separating command
;; outputs into searchable, separate buffers among other things.

This is just a copy-pasta of the `async-shell-command' that has all the
superfluous stuff ripped out.  It also sets up a process environment for
the command that optionally enables ANSI colors.

In Elisp, you will often be better served by calling `call-process' or
`start-process' directly, since they offer more control and do not
impose the use of a shell (with its need to quote arguments)."
